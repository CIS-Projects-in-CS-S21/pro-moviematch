# Movie Match

## Project overview
MovieMatch is a mobile application that will focus on streamlining the content selection process for streaming services. Movies/shows will be presented one at a time on the screen for users to like and dislike. They will then have access to the list of their liked shows as well as be recommended shows that are similar to the ones they have liked previously. Users will then be able to join groups in which all of their likes will be compared, resulting in a list of the group's most preferred content. Groups will then be able to review content after viewing.
